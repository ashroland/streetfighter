### keycombo-driven replacement for browsers' default new-tab page

---

## Under HEAVY development, most user-friendly features have not been implemented yet so use at your own discretion

---

### philosophy

provide the end-user a very quick jumping-off point for new tabs. make 
that user interface keyboard-driven. provide omnibox-like search. make 
all user functions for adding and removing links keyboard-driven. keep 
it legible vanilla JS. 

---

### TO-DO

- ✓ Default links for new visitor
- More apparent keystroke highlighting

- HTML5 Web Storage
	- ✓ all Links stored as objects on users' computer
	- ✓ load / save function 
	- ✓ interface for making / removing / ordering links
		 - keystrokes for these -- HOLD FOR OMNIBOX
	- Save to File
	- Load from File
	- Reminder system to back up links

- "Omnibox" - sublimetext-like menu for all user functions
	- ✓ many search engines
	- Update behavior
		- selecting a menu option w arrows clears userinputstring but doesn't clear out search results
